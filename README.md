# Simulation-of-Internal-Temperature

Simulation code developed in Python to simulate theoretical internal temperatures of a food unit while its heating using measured values of  the Length, Thickness(Height), Thermal Conductivity, Density, and Specific Heat of that unit. 

The simulation shown is based on a Fuji Apple with measured quantities:
L=0.15
H=0.025
k=0.418
rho = 840
cp = 3810

Where L is Length, H is Thickness/Height, k is Thermal Conductivity, rho is Density, and cp is specific heat.
