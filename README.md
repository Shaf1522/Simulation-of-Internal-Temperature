# Simulation of Internal Temperature

Simulation code developed in Python to simulate theoretical internal temperatures of a food unit while its heating using measured values of  the Length, Thickness(Height), Thermal Conductivity, Density, and Specific Heat of that unit. 


## Simualation of an Apple with measured parameters
The simulation shown is based on a Fuji Apple with measured quantities:

L=0.15

H=0.025

k=0.418

rho = 840

cp = 3810


Where L is Length, H is Thickness/Height, k is Thermal Conductivity, rho is Density, and cp is specific heat.


## Results & Fourier Simulation Plots

Resulting plots of the simulation can be viewed in the Results folder. After every 3 minutes, a new fourier plot is created.
